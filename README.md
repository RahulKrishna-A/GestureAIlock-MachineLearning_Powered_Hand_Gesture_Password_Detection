# Gesturelock-Hand_Gesture_Password_Detection

**GestureLock**  is a web application that utilizes MediaPipe ML library to detect hand landmarks and process them to identify the gestures displayed. It offers a secure and innovative approach to password authentication by replacing traditional alphanumeric passwords with hand gestures.

## Key Features

- Gesture Recognition: GestureLoc accurately detects and recognizes various hand gestures(which is currently limited to digits 1 to 5).
- Password Replacement: Users can create a personalized hand gesture password instead of using traditional alphanumeric passwords.
- Secure Authentication: GestureLock provides an additional layer of security by utilizing unique hand gestures for user authentication.
- User-Friendly Interface: The web application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for seamless user experience.

## MediaPipe

MediaPipe is google's Library which provides pre-trained models, algorithms, and APIs specifically designed for hand tracking and recognition tasks. By leveraging these resources, GestureLoc ensures reliable and precise hand gesture recognition, enhancing the security and usability of the web application.
